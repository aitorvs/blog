      <description>Why blogging? this is a question that only recently, after talking to a very wise person, I came to a good answer for.
A bit of context, I like blogging. And at the same time, I struggle to be consistent about it. For the past years my blogging has been in bursts and pretty much I have always stopped because of the same reasons:
 frictions about the tooling to blog - see this for more insight on that I considered that the themes I was thinking about blogging were not worth putting out there  The second bullet above is the one that has been more difficult to overcome&amp;hellip;until now.</description>

      <description>This is the Nth first blog post for my (new) blog. My requirements for blogging are simple, I just care about writing and I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to waste a lot of time typing commands to create the blog, to format it, or publish it&amp;hellip;or any of that.
In the past I have tried several solutions such as:
 Medium &amp;ndash; I liked it because it pretty much meet my requirements, I was just concern about writing.</description>
