Why blogging? this is a question that only recently, after talking to a very wise person, I came to a good answer for.

A bit of context, I like blogging. And at the same time, I struggle to be consistent about it. For the past years my blogging has been in bursts and pretty much I have always stopped because of the same reasons:
* frictions about the tooling to blog - see [this](https://aitorvs.github.io/blog/posts/24/) for more insight on that
* I considered that the themes I was thinking about blogging were not worth putting out there

The second bullet above is the one that has been more difficult to overcome...until now.

While chatting about this topic, I was encourage to look at this from a different angle. That is, what's the value for me?
And the reality is that I get a lot of energy from writing about stuff. Many times happens that I take the decision not to publish what I've written after I have written it. 
And looking back to those never-published draft posts, I don't have any regret. Because I enjoyed writing them and I got a lot of energy in that process.

So to come back to initial question of **Why blogging?** the answer is: because it gives me a lot of energy. I will let you decide what value my posts provide to you.
