CLI tools are a [big part](https://aitorvs.github.io/blog/posts/60/) of my day to day. But some of the most common ones have not evolved much for a while.
There are some good replacements for them.

### `bat` for `cat`
[`bat`](https://t.co/q6ubwN86cE) is like `cat` but with syntax highlighting.

```bash
$ brew install bat
$ alias cat=bat
```

### `exa` for `ls`
Use it instead of `ls`.

```bash
$ brew install exa
$ alias ls=exa
```

### `fd` for `find`
I find [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) faster and simpler alternative to `find`.

```bash
$ brew install fd
```


### `fig` for your terminal
Super power your terminal with [`fig`](https://fig.io/)

### `fzf` for better searches
Checkout the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgG5Jhi_Els).

```bash
$ brew install fzf

# Install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion:
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

Hope some of these tools increase your productivity or at least make your day to day more joyful.
