  </h1>
  <time datetime="2022-01-01T00:00:00Z" class="post-date">Sat, Jan 1, 2022</time>
  As your application grows, you hopefully organize your code into several gradle (library) modules. You can do that to isolate/decouple features, or to build common libraries for your code base, etc.
One pain point when starting doing this is that gradle modules tend to like to be in the project root folder, having a structure like the following: &ndash; my-app | &ndash; feature-a | &ndash; feature-b | &ndash; feature-c | &ndash; lib-a | &ndash; lib-b | &ndash; lib-b

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2021-12-09T00:00:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, Dec 9, 2021</time>
  Why blogging? this is a question that only recently, after talking to a very wise person, I came to a good answer for.
A bit of context, I like blogging. And at the same time, I struggle to be consistent about it. For the past years my blogging has been in bursts and pretty much I have always stopped because of the same reasons:
 frictions about the tooling to blog - see this for more insight on that I considered that the themes I was thinking about blogging were not worth putting out there  The second bullet above is the one that has been more difficult to overcome&hellip;until now.

  This is the Nth first blog post for my (new) blog. My requirements for blogging are simple, I just care about writing and I don&rsquo;t really want to waste a lot of time typing commands to create the blog, to format it, or publish it&hellip;or any of that.
In the past I have tried several solutions such as:
 Medium &ndash; I liked it because it pretty much meet my requirements, I was just concern about writing.

  Hi,
I am not very consistent at writing but sometimes you&rsquo;ll find some content here. You can also find me on Medium.
