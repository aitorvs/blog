  <h1>Why blogging</h1>
  <time datetime=2021-12-09T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Thu, Dec 9, 2021</time>
  <p>Why blogging? this is a question that only recently, after talking to a very wise person, I came to a good answer for.</p>
<p>A bit of context, I like blogging. And at the same time, I struggle to be consistent about it. For the past years my blogging has been in bursts and pretty much I have always stopped because of the same reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>frictions about the tooling to blog - see <a href="https://aitorvs.github.io/blog/posts/24/">this</a> for more insight on that</li>
<li>I considered that the themes I was thinking about blogging were not worth putting out there</li>
</ul>
<p>The second bullet above is the one that has been more difficult to overcome&hellip;until now.</p>
<p>While chatting about this topic, I was encourage to look at this from a different angle. That is, what&rsquo;s the value for me?
And the reality is that I get a lot of energy from writing about stuff. Many times happens that I take the decision not to publish what I&rsquo;ve written after I have written it.
And looking back to those never-published draft posts, I don&rsquo;t have any regret. Because I enjoyed writing them and I got a lot of energy in that process.</p>
<p>So to come back to initial question of <strong>Why blogging?</strong> the answer is: because it gives me a lot of energy. I will let you decide what value my posts provide to you.</p>
